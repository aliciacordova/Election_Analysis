# Election_Analysis
The purpose of this review is to help Tom conduct an audit so he can discuss it with the Colorado Board of Elections.
For this, an analysis was carried out where the total of the votes, the candidates who participated and what were their results (in % and number of votes) were obtained. Also, it was shown who was the candidate who won the election and with what participation.

Aditionally, we want to help Tom get the breakdown of the results by county. In this way we add to the analysis and modify the original script, which were the results by county (in % and number of votes) and which was the winning county.
